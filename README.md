# rose_code
ROSE (Rate Of Scattering Events) a dynamical Monte Carlo code,
implemented for studying the photon-photon scattering and then extended to
other particle collisions and decays, as BWPP, TPP, Compton and MÃ¸ller
scattering. Its main peculiarity is that it treats the scattering between
two relativistic and realistic beams, following their time evolution in the
laboratory frame. Starting from two colliding beams of massive particles or
photons (say beam 1 and beam 2) de ned through the phase spaces of an
appropriate number N1,2 of macro particles of weight respectively q1,2,
the procedure entails the denition of a common space grid where the kinematics
takes place. The tracking of both beams during their overlapping up to the end
of the scattering process permits to dimension the total space window.
