# rose_code
ROSE (Rate Of Scattering Events) a dynamical Monte Carlo code, implemented for studying the photon-photon scattering and then extended to other particle collisions and decays, as BWPP, TPP, Compton and Møller scat- tering. Its main peculiarity is that it treats the scattering between two relativistic and realistic beams, following their time evolution in the laboratory frame. Starting from two colliding beams of massive particles or pho- tons (say beam 1 and beam 2) de ned through the phase spaces of an appropriate number N1,2 of macro particles of weight respectively q1,2, the procedure entails the denition of a common space grid where the kinematics takes place. The tracking of both beams during their overlap- ping up to the end of the scattering process permits to dimension the total space window.
